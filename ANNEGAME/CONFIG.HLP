This   screen  lets  you  tell
Game-Maker about  the hardware
information which is  specific
to your system.  

Yellow  rectangles   highlight
the  current  hardware  infor-
mation.    

To enter  new  hardware infor-
mation, use the  mouse  or the
arrow  keys to select  a  menu
item;   then press <Enter>  or
<Return>  to  change  to  that
selection.   Selecting an item
highlights  it with  a  yellow
rectangle  and  unselects  the
previously selected item.

Sound And Music:

If  you  own  a Sound  Blaster
compatible sound board you can
listen to  digitized sound and
music while playing games.

If you have  a  Sound  Blaster
Pro and you installed  it nor-
mally,   the  correct  set  up
should be highlighted.  Other-
wise, you first  need to enter
which Port and Interrupt  your
Sound  Blaster is set to  use.
If  you  do  not know what  to
choose, try experimenting.  If
the  port  is  wrong,  neither
music nor sound will work.  If
the interrupt is wrong but the
port is  correct,  music  will
work but sound will not.

You  also  need  to  specify a
Sound Blaster driver for sound
to work.   The  default driver
is  called  "sndblast.drv" and
is   located  in  the  current
directory (.\).   SNDBLAST.DRV
and .\ are preinstalled in the
two  menu fields found on  the
lower    left    side  of  the
configuration   menu.     This
driver is compatible  with the
"CT-Voice"    driver  used  by
Creative  Labs' Sound Blaster.

If  the   preinstalled  driver
does not work,  then  use  the
driver  that  your sound  card
supplies.    Put  the driver's
full name  in  the first field
(e.g., CT-VOICE.DRV), and  put
its path in the  second  field
(e.g., C:\sound\).


Video Cards:
  
Ninty-nine  percent of the VGA
chips will  be  correctly  de-
tected  automatically.    Thus
you should leave "AUTO-DETECT"
chosen  unless  you have video
problems.  

If  during  a  game  you  move
vertically  and the  character
seems to disappear, or  random
dots  scroll  onto the screen,
your  VGA chip was incorrectly
detected.     To  remedy  this
problem, select your chip type
from the menu.

Video    card    manufacturers
usually  obtain   their  video
controller chips from  one  of
the  chip  vendors  that  this
software supports.  So if  the
name of your video board isn't
on our  list,  just experiment
with  different video  choices
until  one  works.

If your  board still  does not
work, choose "Simulate".  This
option   enables   a  software
simulation of a VGA card.  Use
this as a last resort, though,
because   animation   in  slow
computers (386s) may not be as
smooth.
