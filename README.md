# game-maker-games

A small collection of Game-Maker games which I made in the mid 90's. Game-Maker was a DOS game engine which allowed novices such as myself to build simple games.

## Games

### Annegame

A game about earth worms and leeches, also known as *annelids*. Made in 1996 for a Year 7 school project.

### JIM

Jim's Adventure Next Door, probably an unfinished game, from 1996.

### RESPY

A game about respiration, made in 1997 for a Year 8 school project.
